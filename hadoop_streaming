hadoop streaming 

main idea of hadoop design is data processing is independent of language or atleast shuld be so flexible that program can be designed in any language to do the processing 

Idea is that data should be outlived of any programing language 

hadoop streaming uses unix std.io as a interface between hadoop and your program 

Hadoop pipes 
Its just a name to hadoop c++ . Unlike hadoop straming with uses the unix standard stream to interact with hadoop , c++ uses socket as a channel to communicate with task tracker
